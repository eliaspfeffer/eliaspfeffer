## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm an engineer (B.Eng in Mechatronics - Automation).
- ðŸŒ± You can learn about me via my public CV www.eliaspfeffer.de
- I would love to help projects related to Bitcoin / AGI / making Ai consciouss :)
- Would consider myself a 5X Developer. Not quite there yet to call me a 10X but definitely faster and better than average and on the way to 10X.
- My big projects are all private, sorry.
- Iâ€™m currently working on a Bitcoin Bank, a Bitcoin Trading Bot (www.BitcoinAlgoTra.de) & an AGI concept of mine. 
- Fun fact: I've sit on the same ðŸš½ as Elon. Weird fun fact, I know. Lol.
